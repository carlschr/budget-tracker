# Budget Tracker

## About the Project
This project was an introduction to progressive web apps. It utilizes a service worker to store data using indexedDB while offline and then posts the cached data when back online. All files not relevant to the service worker and indexdDB were provided by the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp.
